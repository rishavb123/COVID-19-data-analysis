Modeling:

    N_d = Number of cases on a given day d
    E = Average number of people someone infected is exposed to each day
    p = Probability of each exposure becoming an infection

    Exponential Growth:

        \delta N_d = E * p * N_d
        N_{d+1} = N_d + E * p * N_d
        N_{d+1} = (1 + E * p) * N_d
        N_d = [(1 + E * p) ^ d] * N_0

    Logistic Growth:

        dN/dt = c * (1 - N/pop) * N
        indistinguishable from exponential growth in the begening
        find points of inflection -> at this point we are about half way through the virus
        Look for the growth factor: \delta N_d / \delta N_{d-1}
        before inflection growth factor < 1
        at point of inflection growth factor = 1
        after inflection growth factor > 1

    Use Gradient Descent to minimize mse loss to fit some of the models by finding the parameters for exponential and logistic growth (rather than just using polyfit)

Comparisons between countries:

    Matrix (and other) transformations from one country to another
    Time shifts from one to another (country A is 1 month ahead of country B)
